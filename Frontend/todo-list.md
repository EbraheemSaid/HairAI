- Missing implementations for:
  - Patient management pages (list, create, edit, detail)
  - Analysis workflow pages (new analysis, session view, report)
  - Settings pages (calibration, clinic, users, subscription)
  - Admin pages (clinics, subscriptions)
  - Registration and invitation acceptance pages

### ❌ Form Handling
- React Hook Form integration is included but not utilized in most forms
- Validation schemas are missing
- No proper form submission handling with API integration

### ❌ Error Handling
- Limited error handling in API calls
- No proper error display to users
- Missing loading states for async operations

### ❌ Admin Dashboard
- No package.json or build configuration
- No main application entry point (App.tsx)
- No routing configuration
- Essentially an empty shell

### ❌ Testing
- No unit tests
- No integration tests
- No end-to-end tests

### ❌ Documentation

## Conclusion

The frontend has a solid foundation with proper project structure and core infrastructure in place. However, it lacks actual implementation of most features and API integration. The next steps should focus on connecting the frontend to the backend API and implementing the missing page components.

With the comprehensive backend API we've built, the frontend can be fully implemented by following the todo list above. The priority should be on core functionality first, followed by the analysis workflow, and then the admin features.
