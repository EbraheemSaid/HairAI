# HairAI SaaS Platform

A hardware-agnostic, AI-powered hair analysis SaaS platform for trichology and hair transplant clinics.

## Project Status: âœ… MOSTLY COMPLETE

The HairAI platform has been successfully architected and largely implemented as a comprehensive SaaS solution for hair analysis in clinical settings.

## Overview

HairAI is a sophisticated SaaS platform designed for trichology and hair transplant clinics. It leverages AI-powered analysis of trichoscope images to provide consistent, data-driven metrics to support doctors in diagnosis and treatment planning.

The platform automates the analysis of trichoscope images, providing key metrics such as hair count, density, follicular units, and more. It's designed to be hardware-agnostic, working with any trichoscope camera that can capture digital images.

## Architecture

The platform follows a microservices architecture with the following key components:

### 1. Backend API (.NET 8) âœ… COMPLETE
Central to the application, built with ASP.NET Core Web API following Clean Architecture principles. Manages business logic, data orchestration, security, and communication with other services.

### 2. Frontend Applications âœ… MOSTLY COMPLETE
- **Clinical Application**: Main application for doctors and clinic admins
- **Admin Dashboard**: SuperAdmin dashboard for platform management

Built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS with a comprehensive component library.

### 3. AI Worker (Python) ðŸš§ READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION
A dedicated background service for AI model inference, consuming analysis jobs from a message queue, performing object detection using a YOLOv8s ONNX model, and writing results back to the database.

### 4. Infrastructure âœ… COMPLETE
Containerized with Docker and orchestrated using Docker Compose:
- **Reverse Proxy (Nginx)**: Single, secure public entry point
- **Database (PostgreSQL)**: Single source of truth for all persistent data
- **Message Queue (RabbitMQ)**: Asynchronous communication backbone

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Docker
- Docker Compose

### Quick Start
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd HairAI

# Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# Access the applications:
# - Main Application: http://localhost
# - Admin Dashboard: http://localhost/admin
# - API Documentation: http://localhost/api/docs

# Alternatively, start only the backend API and database (for API testing):
# - Windows: start-api-db.bat
# - Linux/Mac: ./start-api-db.sh

# To stop the services:
# - All services: docker-compose down
# - Backend API and database only: stop-api-db.bat (Windows) or ./stop-api-db.sh (Linux/Mac)
```

## Starting the Backend API and Database Only

For development and testing purposes, you can start just the backend API and database containers without the other services:

### Windows
```cmd
start-api-db.bat
```

### Linux/Mac
```bash
./start-api-db.sh
```

### Manual Docker Commands
You can also start the services manually using Docker Compose:

```bash
# Start the services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.api.yml up -d

# Check the status of the containers
docker-compose -f docker-compose.api.yml ps

# View logs
docker-compose -f docker-compose.api.yml logs

# Stop the services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.api.yml down
```

Once started, the services will be available at:
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:5000
- **Database**: localhost:5432 (PostgreSQL)

You can test the API endpoints using the provided Postman collection or curl commands.
